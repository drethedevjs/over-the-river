    <h2>What is "Over the River"</h2>
    <p>
      In our family, the phrase “over the river” isn't just a geographic reference — it's part of
      our shared language and history. In earlier generations, our family was rooted in both
      Cincinnati, Ohio and Covington, Kentucky, two cities separated by the Ohio River.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the day, whenever there was a reunion, cookout, or any random family event, the
      natural question was, “Where's it going to be?” And the answer could be, “Over the river.” The
      meaning depended on where you were asking from: in Covington, it meant heading to Cincinnati,
      and in Cincinnati, it meant crossing into Covington. It was a simple phrase that referenced
      the city of gathering.

    <h2>Della Porterfield</h2>

    <p>
      Della Porterfield, the beloved matriarch of our family, was a woman of quiet strength and
      remarkable determination. Born in Dry Ridge, Kentucky, she raised her seven children with
      unwavering love, resilience, and grace — often doing it all on her own. Through hard work and
      a heart full of compassion, she created a home rooted in kindness and mutual respect.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of her deepest commitments was to education. It was imperative to her that every one of
      her children graduated high school — a goal she proudly accomplished through tireless effort
      and unshakable belief in their potential.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of her children's fondest memories are of simple joys, like days spent together at
      Fernbank Park in Cincinnati — moments filled with laughter, connection, and the kind of peace
      only a mother's presence can provide. Della taught her children to treat others the way they
      want to be treated — a timeless lesson that continues to echo through our family's values and
      relationships today.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her legacy lives on in the lives of her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren — a
      living testament to the love she gave and the lessons she instilled.

    <p>
      The Martin's story is deeply rooted in the love, strength, and unwavering faith of Big Grannie
      (Philmore Martin) and Little Grannie (Marie Porterfield). As the patriarch and matriarch of
      our family, they laid the foundation for the joy, unity, and resilience that we are blessed to
      share today. Through their sacrifices, wisdom, and endless care, they built a legacy that
      continues to grow with every generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though they have both passed on, their spirit lives brightly in each of us. We honor their
      memory with deep gratitude, knowing that the big, happy family we celebrate today is a
      reflection of their enduring love and the example they set for us all. Their lives remind us
      that family is not just about blood — it's about the bonds we nurture, the traditions we carry
      forward, and the love we share across time and distance.
