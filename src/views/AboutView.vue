    <h2>What is "Over the River"</h2>
    <p>
      In our family, the phrase “over the river” isn't just a geographic reference — it's part of
      our shared language and history. In earlier generations, our family was rooted in both
      Cincinnati, Ohio and Covington, Kentucky, two cities separated by the Ohio River.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the day, whenever there was a reunion, cookout, or any random family event, the
      natural question was, “Where's it going to be?” And the answer could be, “Over the river.” The
      meaning depended on where you were asking from: in Covington, it meant heading to Cincinnati,
      and in Cincinnati, it meant crossing into Covington. It was a simple phrase that referenced
      the city of gathering.

    <h2>Big Grannie / Little Grannie</h2>

    <p>
      Our family's story is deeply rooted in the love, strength, and unwavering faith of Big Grannie
      and Little Grannie. As the patriarch and matriarch of our family, they laid the foundation for
      the joy, unity, and resilience that we are blessed to share today. Through their sacrifices,
      wisdom, and endless care, they built a legacy that continues to grow with every generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though they have both passed on, their spirit lives brightly in each of us. We honor their
      memory with deep gratitude, knowing that the big, happy family we celebrate today is a
      reflection of their enduring love and the example they set for us all. Their lives remind us
      that family is not just about blood — it's about the bonds we nurture, the traditions we carry
      forward, and the love we share across time and distance.
