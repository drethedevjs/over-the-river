    <h2>What is "Over the River"</h2>
    <p>
      In our family, the phrase “over the river” isn't just a geographic reference — it's part of
      our shared language and history. In earlier generations, our family was rooted in both
      Cincinnati, Ohio and Covington, Kentucky, two cities separated by the Ohio River.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the day, whenever there was a reunion, cookout, or any random family event, the
      natural question was, “Where's it going to be?” And the answer could be, “Over the river.” The
      meaning depended on where you were asking from: in Covington, it meant heading to Cincinnati,
      and in Cincinnati, it meant crossing into Covington. It was a simple phrase that referenced
      the city of gathering.
