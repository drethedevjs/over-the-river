      We had an amazing time reconnecting, laughing, and making new memories together. The weekend
      kicked off at Main Event, where we held our meet-and-greet. We played games, shared stories,
      and some even hit the bowling lanes — a perfect start to the celebration.

      The following day, we gathered at Mt. Airy Park for more fellowship, a delicious meal, and a
      time of heartfelt recognition. We honored those who helped bring the event together,
      celebrated the dads in our lives for Father's Day, and acknowledged the significant family
      members whose love and legacy continue to guide us.
